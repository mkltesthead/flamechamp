UPDATES:

- Please ignore the Dropbox reference in the PDF file. It is supposed to say Virtualbox. 

- In the Speed Walkthrough, there are references to "lotchbox". This isn't being used because participants can name the box what they want to. 

- Default name of the Jenkins server is http://osboxes:9191/
